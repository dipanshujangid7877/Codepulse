 * AVOID: `KeybindingHint` is nearly always sufficient for providing both visible and accessible keyboard hints, and

 * However, there may be cases where we need a plain string version, such as when building `aria-label` or
 * `aria-description`. In that case, this plain string builder can be used instead.
 *
 * NOTE that this string should _only_ be used when building `aria-label` or `aria-description` props (never rendered
 * visibly) and should nearly always also be paired with a visible hint for sighted users.
